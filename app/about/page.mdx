## What is this?

Over the holidays, my sister gifted me a **Raspberry Pi** <RaspberryPi className="inline w-4 -mt-1" />. Thanks, sis! 🫶

If you haven't heard of them, a Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer. But unlike other computers, these things don't ship with a screen or keyboard or anything really. The big selling point of my model is that [it comes with a power button 🤯🤯🤯](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20not%20all-,Power%20button,-Dual%204Kp60).

They're not the best gaming pc out there, but they're great for hacking and DIY tech projects. You can make robots, smart home devices, and even use them as a server for your website, which is what I did here.

After some tinkering and late-night coding sessions, this little project came to life—my first **self-hosted website**!

Naturally, the theme is **dog photos** because why not? Dogs are sick. 🐶

## Inspiration

I started programming in 2021, and since then I've always relied on _The Cloud_ ☁️ to host my websites. Services like Vercel, Netlify and others make it really easy.

With this project, I wanted to step outside my comfort zone and dive into the world of **self-hosting**. It felt like the perfect way to fill some knowledge gaps, satisfy my curiosity, and get familiar with my new Raspberry Pi.

<span>I also had some fun making custom components, like these </span>
<RotatingGradientBorder
  backgroundColor="transparent"
  borderRadius="12px"
  containerClassName="mx-1 inline-block align-middle bg-background">
  <span className="px-2 bg-background rounded-full">Glowing Gradient Borders</span>
</RotatingGradientBorder>
<span>. Building this site was a ton of fun—and I learned a lot along the way! 🧠</span>

## The Setup (for dummies)

## What is the internet?

Just a bunch of computers connected to each other.

## Like.. my computer?

Yeah, kind of. There are **servers** and **clients**. Your computer is the **client**. My raspberry pi is the **server**.

## How does it get from over there to here?

Cables mostly. And maybe some wifi.

## How did our computers find each other?

IP Addresses, URLs and DNS.

Every computer gets a unique IP Address. Then, with the help of the Domain Name System (DNS), "pi.rioredwards.com" (my URL) gets routed to the right place (my raspberry pi).

I bought my domain name from Cloudflare and then configured it to point to my raspberry pi.

## What makes a computer a server?

Any computer can be a server! Even yours! You can download a web-server for free right now!

BUT if you want it to be accessible from the internet, you need to change some settings on your router or use a service like Cloudflare. Also, if you don't know what your doing, you could break the whole internet and get in big trouble.

Just kidding...

If you want to dive deeper, I'd recommend checking out this article I wrote: [What is the backend?](https://medium.com/@rioedwards/what-is-the-backend-ffd808ff950e).

### Development & Deployment

- **Coding:** I write code on my laptop and push updates to GitHub when ready to deploy
- **Deploying:** The entire app runs in Docker containers on the Pi. A simple update script pulls the latest code, rebuilds containers, and runs migrations automatically
- **Serving:** Cloudflare Tunnels securely routes traffic to the Pi (easier and safer than port forwarding). Nginx handles static assets efficiently

### Connecting to the Pi

My laptop connects via Raspberry Pi Connect and SSH. I also hooked the Pi up to a TV with a keyboard and mouse for direct access. Only one method is necessary, but I had fun experimenting!

### Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend      | Next, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN               |
| Backend       | PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM                             |
| AI Validation | FastAPI service for NSFW detection and dog verification |
| Auth          | NextAuth.js with GitHub and Google OAuth                |
| Monitoring    | Real-time stats dashboard via Server-Sent Events        |

### How It Works

**Database:** All photo metadata is stored in PostgreSQL. Images are stored as files on disk. Schema changes are managed through migrations that run automatically on deployment.

**AI Validation:** Before any photo uploads, it goes through an AI service that checks for NSFW content and verifies the image actually contains a dog. This keeps the gallery on-brand and appropriate.

**Live Monitoring:** The site includes a real-time system stats dashboard showing CPU, memory, disk usage, temperature, network activity, and container health. It's powered by a system-profiler service that streams metrics via SSE—a great way to see the Pi working in real-time!

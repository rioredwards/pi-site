## What is this?

Over the holidays, my sister gifted me a **Raspberry Pi** <RaspberryPi className="inline w-4 -mt-1" />. Thanks, sis! 🫶

If you haven't heard of them, a Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer. Why would you want a tiny computer? Idk... stuff. Like, whatever you want! It's _your_ tiny computer.

Well, in this case, it's _my_ tiny computer.

After some tinkering and late-night coding sessions, this little project came to life—my first **self-hosted website**!

Naturally, the theme is **dog photos** because my life pretty much revolves around these majestic furballs. 🐶

## Inspiration

I started programming in 2021, and since then I've always relied on _The Cloud_ ☁️ to deploy my websites.

With this project, I wanted to step outside my comfort zone and dive into the world of **self-hosting**. It felt like the perfect way to fill some knowledge gaps, satisfy my curiosity, and get familiar with my new Raspberry Pi.

Building this site was a ton of fun—and I learned a lot along the way! 🧠

## The Setup

_For the techy people_

### Development & Deployment

- **Coding:** I write code on my laptop and push updates to GitHub when ready to deploy
- **Deploying:** The entire app runs in Docker containers on the Pi. A simple update script pulls the latest code, rebuilds containers, and runs migrations automatically
- **Serving:** Cloudflare Tunnels securely routes traffic to the Pi (easier and safer than port forwarding). Nginx handles static assets efficiently

### Connecting to the Pi

My laptop connects via Raspberry Pi Connect and SSH. I also hooked the Pi up to a TV with a keyboard and mouse for direct access. Only one method is necessary, but I had fun experimenting!

### Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend      | Next, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN               |
| Backend       | PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM                             |
| AI Validation | FastAPI service for NSFW detection and dog verification |
| Auth          | NextAuth.js with GitHub and Google OAuth                |
| Monitoring    | Real-time stats dashboard via Server-Sent Events        |

### How It Works

**Database:** All photo metadata is stored in PostgreSQL. Images are stored as files on disk. Schema changes are managed through migrations that run automatically on deployment.

**AI Validation:** Before any photo uploads, it goes through an AI service that checks for NSFW content and verifies the image actually contains a dog. This keeps the gallery on-brand and appropriate.

**Live Monitoring:** The site includes a real-time system stats dashboard showing CPU, memory, disk usage, temperature, network activity, and container health. It's powered by a system-profiler service that streams metrics via SSE—a great way to see the Pi working in real-time!
